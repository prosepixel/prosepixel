## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate Software Engineer, specialized in front-end development using React and TypeScript. As an advocate for web performance and accessibility and an evangelist for the Jamstack, I create amazing web applications to make the internet a better place. I'm also fascinated by blockchain technology and its potential to transform various industries, from finance to supply chain management. I enjoy exploring how decentralized applications (dApps) can enhance user experiences and foster greater transparency.

Always happy to help you grow your tech career through mentorship. Please feel free to reach out, if you need help!
